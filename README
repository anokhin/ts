If something says "ages", read it as "friends" in this branch.
This branch is for predicting amount of friends, not ages.
If you want to predict ages (that branch is really better),
see branch naive_bayes.

cross_validation.py:
    python2 cross_validation.py --data $FILENAME --intervals $INTERVALS --cv_groups CV_GROUPS
        cross_validate data in $FILENAME, CV_GROUPS fold, break friends' amount
        into $INTERVALS intervals

predict.py:
    python2 predict.py --train $TRAIN_FILENAME --predict $PREDICT_FILENAME --intervals $INTERVALS
        predict friends' amounts for $PREDICT_FILENAME, train on $TRAIN_FILENAME
        break amounts into $INTERVALS intervals
